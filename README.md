## About Project

This project combines Rust, Raylib, and PyTorch to create a maze and solve it using AI. It provides a visual representation of the maze and the AI's pathfinding.

## Technologies

- **Rust & Raylib Maze Generation**: The maze is generated using Rust and rendered with the Raylib library, providing an interactive visual experience.

- **PyTorch AI Solver**: An AI agent implemented in PyTorch navigates the maze to find the optimal path. You can choose different AI algorithms for pathfinding.

- **Interactive Visuals**: Real-time visualization of the maze and AI's progress.

## Final Product

The final product is an interactive maze solver that uses AI to find the optimal path through a generated maze.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hispalus1/AI-torch.git

2. **Python Environment**: Create a Python environment for PyTorch. You can do this using virtual environments in Python. Here's how:

   ```bash
   python -m venv maze-env
   source maze-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "maze-env\Scripts\activate"

3. **Rust setup**: Setup maze-generator for AI to explore:
   ```bash
   cd rust-maze/source
   cargo build --release
